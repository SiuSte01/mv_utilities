<h2>DBI specification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">DBI</span> package defines the generic DataBase Interface for R.
The connection to individual DBMS is made by packages that import <span class="pkg">DBI</span>
(so-called <EM>DBI backends</EM>).
This document formalizes the behavior expected by the functions declared in
<span class="pkg">DBI</span> and implemented by the individal backends.
</p>
<p>To ensure maximum portability and exchangeability, and to reduce the effort
for implementing a new DBI backend, the <span class="pkg">DBItest</span> package defines
a comprehensive set of test cases that test conformance to the DBI
specification.
In fact, this document is derived from comments in the test definitions of
the <span class="pkg">DBItest</span> package.
This ensures that an extension or update to the tests will be reflected in
this document.
</p>


<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>A DBI backend is an R package,
which should import the <span class="pkg">DBI</span>
and <span class="pkg">methods</span>
packages.
For better or worse, the names of many existing backends start with
&lsquo;R&rsquo;, e.g., <span class="pkg">RSQLite</span>, <span class="pkg">RMySQL</span>, <span class="pkg">RSQLServer</span>; it is up
to the package author to adopt this convention or not.
</p>


<h3>Driver</h3>

<p>Each DBI backend implements a <DFN>driver class</DFN>,
which must be an S4 class and inherit from the <code>DBIDriver</code> class.
This section describes the construction of, and the methods defined for,
this driver class.
</p>


<h4>Construction</h4>

<p>The backend must support creation of an instance of this driver class
with a <DFN>constructor function</DFN>.
By default, its name is the package name without the leading &lsquo;R&rsquo;
(if it exists), e.g., <code>SQLite</code> for the <span class="pkg">RSQLite</span> package.
For the automated tests, the constructor name can be tweaked using the
<code>constructor_name</code> tweak.
</p>
<p>The constructor must be exported, and
it must be a function
that is callable without arguments.
For the automated tests, unless the
<code>constructor_relax_args</code> tweak is set to <code>TRUE</code>,
an empty argument list is expected.
Otherwise, an argument list where all arguments have default values
is also accepted.
</p>



<h4><code>dbDataType("DBIDriver", "ANY")</code></h4>

<p>The backend can override the <code><a href="dbDataType.html">dbDataType</a></code> generic
for its driver class.
This generic expects an arbitrary object as second argument
and returns a corresponding SQL type
as atomic
character value
with at least one character.
As-is objects (i.e., wrapped by <code><a href="../../base/html/I.html">I</a></code>) must be
supported and return the same results as their unwrapped counterparts.
</p>
<p>To query the values returned by the default implementation,
run <code>example(dbDataType, package = "DBI")</code>.
If the backend needs to override this generic,
it must accept all basic R data types as its second argument, namely
<code><a href="../../base/html/logical.html">logical</a></code>,
<code><a href="../../base/html/integer.html">integer</a></code>,
<code><a href="../../base/html/numeric.html">numeric</a></code>,
<code><a href="../../base/html/character.html">character</a></code>,
dates (see <code><a href="../../base/html/Dates.html">Dates</a></code>),
date-time (see <code><a href="../../base/html/DateTimeClasses.html">DateTimeClasses</a></code>),
and <code><a href="../../base/html/difftime.html">difftime</a></code>.
It also must accept lists of <code>raw</code> vectors
and map them to the BLOB (binary large object) data type.
The behavior for other object types is not specified.
