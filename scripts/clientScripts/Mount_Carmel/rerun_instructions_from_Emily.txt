best way to rerun then is to use the cloning scripts with the vintage for the new all codes? (20160511, think?)

you don't need to set anything back up - you'll basically just push it back into queue from the existing config directory.
but you will need to change the project-level settings.cfg back from "QC" or "Makefile" to "Projections"
depending on what step you were on
